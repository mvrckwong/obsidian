# Obsidian Vault — PARA Structure

This vault is structured using PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive), popularized by Tiago Forte’s Building a Second Brain.

## Folders
- `00 Inbox`: Quick capture. Empty daily by routing items to Projects/Areas/Resources/Archive.
- `10 Projects`: Short-term outcomes with clear end states. One note per project.
- `20 Areas`: Ongoing responsibilities to maintain to a standard.
- `30 Resources`: Reference material for future use.
- `90 Archive`: Inactive items, finished projects, cold references.
- `99 Templates`: Note templates used across the vault.

## Recommended Plugins
- Dataview (for indexes)
- Templater or Core Templates (for `{{date}}`, `{{time}}`)
- Calendar (for daily/weekly notes)

## Getting Started
1. Create a project from `99 Templates/Project Template` and move it to `10 Projects`.
2. Define the next action and keep only 3–5 active next actions.
3. Do a weekly review using `99 Templates/Weekly Review Template`.
4. Keep `00 Inbox` empty by end of day.

## Index Notes (MOCs)
- `10 Projects/Projects Index.md`
- `20 Areas/Areas Index.md`
- `30 Resources/Resources Index.md`
- `90 Archive/Archive Index.md`

> PARA helps you organize by actionability rather than topic. Capture → Clarify → Organize → Execute.
