# Elon Musk Thinking

Core patterns often attributed to Muskâ€™s approach.

## Principles
- First principles: reduce problems to physics/economics and recombine.
- Reason from constraints: identify limiting factors; remove or invert them.
- 10x lens: target order-of-magnitude improvements, not marginal.
- Rate of iteration: ship, learn, iterate quickly.
- Talent density: small teams of exceptional people.

## Prompts
- What assumptions are we inheriting? Which violate physics?
- If we had to do this in 1/10th the cost/time, how?
- What could be true in 5 years we can act on now?
