# Data Engineering Maturity Model

A framework for assessing and improving data engineering capabilities across five levels of maturity.

## Summary
- Organizations progress through five distinct maturity levels from reactive/ad-hoc to intelligent/autonomous
- Each level has specific characteristics, focus areas, and relevant KPIs
- Understanding your current level helps prioritize improvements and set realistic goals

## The Five Maturity Levels

### Level 1: Reactive/Ad-hoc

**Characteristics:**
- Most data work happens in response to urgent requests
- Pipelines are manual scripts or one-off jobs
- Little to no monitoring or alerting
- Data quality issues discovered by end users
- No standardized processes or tools
- Heavy reliance on tribal knowledge

**KPIs at this level:** 
- Basic pipeline success/failure counts
- Major incident frequency

**Focus:** 
Establish basic monitoring and move critical pipelines to scheduled, automated processes.

---

### Level 2: Structured/Repeatable

**Characteristics:**
- Core pipelines are automated and scheduled
- Basic monitoring and alerting in place
- Some documentation exists
- Standard tools and frameworks adopted
- Version control for code
- Data quality checks exist but may be inconsistent

**KPIs at this level:** 
- Pipeline success rate
- MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery)
- Basic data freshness metrics
- Infrastructure costs

**Focus:** 
Standardize practices, improve reliability, build data quality frameworks.

---

### Level 3: Proactive/Managed

**Characteristics:**
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability
- Automated data quality validation
- Clear SLAs defined and tracked
- Self-service capabilities emerging
- Data catalog and documentation maintained
- CI/CD for data pipelines
- Incident response processes established

**KPIs at this level:** 
- MTTD (Mean Time To Detect)
- MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery)
- SLA compliance
- Data quality scores
- Active user counts
- Self-service adoption rates

**Focus:** 
Scale self-service, optimize costs, reduce manual toil, improve developer velocity.

---

### Level 4: Optimized/Data Product Oriented

**Characteristics:**
- Data treated as products with clear owners
- Strong data governance and lineage tracking
- Advanced observability (cost, performance, usage analytics)
- High self-service adoption
- Automated remediation for common issues
- Strong collaboration between data engineers, analysts, and business
- Continuous improvement culture

**KPIs at this level:** 
- Business impact metrics
- Time to insight
- Cost efficiency ratios
- Deployment frequency
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Data product engagement

**Focus:** 
Maximize business value, innovate on new use cases, strategic data architecture.

---

### Level 5: Intelligent/Autonomous

**Characteristics:**
- AI/ML-driven optimization and anomaly detection
- Self-healing pipelines
- Predictive monitoring that prevents issues
- Highly flexible, modular architecture
- Data mesh or federated approaches
- Real-time everything
- Data engineering as strategic competitive advantage

**KPIs at this level:** 
- Predictive reliability metrics
- Business outcome attribution
- Innovation velocity
- Cross-domain data product collaboration

**Focus:** 
Push boundaries, enable new business models, thought leadership.

## How to Use This Model

1. **Assess Current State**: Identify which level best describes your organization
2. **Set Goals**: Determine which level you want to reach in the next 6-12 months
3. **Prioritize Gaps**: Focus on the characteristics and KPIs of your target level
4. **Iterate**: Maturity is a journey, not a destination
