# Data Engineering KPIs and Impact

Key metrics for measuring data engineering effectiveness and demonstrating business value.

## Summary
- Data engineering impact spans technical reliability, business outcomes, and organizational efficiency
- Metrics should align with organizational maturity level
- Balance leading indicators (technical) with lagging indicators (business impact)

## Key Categories

### 1. Technical Reliability Metrics

#### Pipeline Success Rate
- **What it is:** % of pipeline runs that complete successfully
- **Target:** >95% for production pipelines, >99% for critical pipelines
- **How to measure:** (Successful runs / Total runs) × 100
- **Why it matters:** Core measure of platform stability

#### MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery)
- **What it is:** Average time to fix broken pipelines
- **Target:** <2 hours for critical pipelines, <1 day for standard
- **How to measure:** Sum of downtime / Number of incidents
- **Why it matters:** Measures incident response effectiveness

#### MTTD (Mean Time To Detect)
- **What it is:** Average time to discover an issue
- **Target:** <15 minutes for critical data
- **How to measure:** Time from failure to alert acknowledgment
- **Why it matters:** Early detection prevents downstream impacts

#### Data Freshness
- **What it is:** Time lag between source update and availability in warehouse
- **Target:** Varies by use case (real-time to daily)
- **How to measure:** Timestamp in warehouse - timestamp in source
- **Why it matters:** Critical for time-sensitive decisions

#### SLA Compliance
- **What it is:** % of time data meets agreed service levels
- **Target:** >99% for critical datasets
- **How to measure:** (Periods meeting SLA / Total periods) × 100
- **Why it matters:** Builds trust with stakeholders

### 2. Data Quality Metrics

#### Data Quality Score
- **What it is:** Composite score of completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness
- **Target:** >95% for production datasets
- **Components:**
  - Completeness: % of expected records present
  - Accuracy: % of records passing validation rules
  - Consistency: % matching across systems
  - Timeliness: % delivered within SLA

#### Test Coverage
- **What it is:** % of data models with automated tests
- **Target:** >80% for production models
- **How to measure:** Models with tests / Total models
- **Why it matters:** Prevents regressions

### 3. Business Impact Metrics

#### Active Users
- **What it is:** Number of users actively querying or using data products
- **Target:** Growing month-over-month
- **How to measure:** Track queries, dashboard views, API calls
- **Why it matters:** Direct measure of platform adoption

#### Data Product Usage
- **What it is:** Engagement with specific data products or dashboards
- **Target:** High engagement with critical products
- **Metrics:**
  - Daily/Weekly/Monthly active users
  - Query frequency
  - Dashboard views
- **Why it matters:** Shows which products provide value

#### Time Saved Through Automation
- **What it is:** Manual hours eliminated by automated pipelines
- **How to measure:** Estimate manual time × automation frequency
- **Why it matters:** Quantifies efficiency gains

#### Business Outcomes Influenced
- **What it is:** Revenue, cost savings, or decisions enabled by data products
- **Examples:**
  - Revenue from personalization engine
  - Cost savings from churn prediction
  - Decisions informed by dashboards
- **Why it matters:** Connects data to business results

#### Self-Service Adoption
- **What it is:** % of data requests fulfilled without data team involvement
- **Target:** >70% for mature organizations
- **How to measure:** Self-service queries / Total data requests
- **Why it matters:** Reduces bottlenecks, empowers teams

### 4. Operational Efficiency Metrics

#### Infrastructure Costs
- **What it is:** Total spend on data infrastructure and tools
- **Track:**
  - Cloud compute costs
  - Storage costs
  - SaaS tool subscriptions
- **Optimize:** Cost per query, cost per user, cost per GB processed

#### Developer Velocity
- **What it is:** Speed of delivering new data products
- **Metrics:**
  - Time from request to delivery
  - Deployment frequency
  - Lead time for changes
- **Why it matters:** Shows how efficiently team delivers value

#### Reduction in Manual Requests
- **What it is:** Decrease in ad-hoc data requests to data team
- **Target:** Downward trend as self-service improves
- **Why it matters:** Frees data engineers for strategic work

### 5. Advanced Metrics (Maturity Level 4+)

#### Time to Insight
- **What it is:** Time from question to actionable answer
- **Target:** Minutes to hours (vs. days or weeks)
- **Why it matters:** Measures end-to-end data platform effectiveness

#### Cost Efficiency Ratios
- **Examples:**
  - Cost per active user
  - Cost per query
  - Infrastructure cost as % of revenue
- **Why it matters:** Shows ROI of data investments

#### Deployment Frequency
- **What it is:** How often new data products or pipeline changes deploy
- **Target:** Multiple times per week for mature teams
- **Why it matters:** Indicates CI/CD maturity

#### Customer Satisfaction Score
- **What it is:** Stakeholder satisfaction with data team
- **How to measure:** Quarterly surveys, NPS
- **Why it matters:** Qualitative measure of perceived value
